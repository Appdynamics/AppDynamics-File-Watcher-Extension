If your organization still relies on Windows 7, you likely know a major deadline recently passed: Windows 7 end-of-support.

You’re probably making plans to move to Windows 10. If so, then you realize a large part of the cost of deploying a new operating system (and possibly new hardware) is the migration of user profiles, settings, data – and perhaps applications as well.
